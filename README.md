# Audio Recorder

A React Component using the Web Audio API to record, save, and play audio.


## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [danrouse.github.io/react-audio-recorder](https://danrouse.github.io/react-audio-recorder/)


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-audio-recorder is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/AudioRecorder.min.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-audio-recorder --save
```


## Usage

The `<AudioRecorder>` component can be instantiated with no properties to act as a simple client-side recorder/downloader. `onChange` is called when a recording is finished, with the audio data passed as a blob.

```
import AudioRecorder from 'react-audio-recorder';

<AudioRecorder />
```

For more detailed usage examples, see the [live demo](http://kremonte.github.io/react-audio-recorder/).

### Properties
property|type|default|Description
----|----|-------|-----------
initialAudio|Blob|An initial Blob of audio data
downloadable|boolean|`true`|Whether to show a download button
loop|boolean|`false`|Whether to loop audio playback
filename|string|`'output.wav'`|Downloaded file name
className|string|`''`|CSS class name on the container element
style|Object|`{}`|Inline styles on the container element
onAbort|`() => void`||Callback when playback is stopped
onChange|`(AudioRecorderChangeEvent) => void`||Callback when the recording buffer is modified
onEnded|`() => void`||Callback when playback completes on its own
onPause|`() => void`||(NYI)
onPlay|`() => void`||Callback when playback begins
onRecordStart|`() => void`||Callback when recording begins
playLabel|string|'üîä Play'|Button label
playingLabel|string|'‚ùö‚ùö Playing'|Button label
recordLabel|string|'‚óè Record'|Button label
recordingLabel|string|'‚óè Recording'|Button label
removeLabel|string|'‚úñ Remove'|Button label
downloadLabel|string|'üíæ Save'|Button label

### Notes

This component is intended for use with short sounds only, such as speech samples and sound effects. The WAV encoder is not offloaded to a service worker, to make this component more portable. It is not space efficient either, recording at 1411kbps (16 bit stereo), so long recordings will drain the system of memory.

### Compatibility

Because of its usage of the Web Audio API, react-audio-recorder is not compatible with any version of Internet Explorer (Edge is compatible).


## Development

To use the typescript watcher, run `npm run dev`.
